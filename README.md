### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Regis Djaha is a full-time Research Technician from Ivory Coast at the Basque Centre for Applied Mathematics (BCAM). He is a member of the Machine Learning group, working closely with IÃ±igo Urteaga, since September 2023.

His research is focused on the development and evaluation of deep latent variable models in general, and in particular, variational autoencoders for unsupervised and supervised learning problems. The overarching goal is to apply these techniques across diverse fields, with his research at BCAM representing a significant contribution in the intersection of mathematics and machine learning. Regis has academic training on the foundations of partial differential equations, time-series, machine learning and reinforcement learning, with practical experience on the implementation and evaluation of such techniques in Matlab, R, Python and PyTorch.
